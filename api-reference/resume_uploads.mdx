## Overview
The One Click Apply API only accepts public resume links; If you have a local file, use our /upload_resume API to upload PDF resumes, get the public URL, and use it with our Apply API .

All requests contain the following base URL:
```
https://api.redantai.com/
```

## Authorization
To authenticate with the One Click Apply API, you need to add an `API-Key` header to your request. For example, if your API key is `oca_1jmGxFzT2RJBUY9wOOEC3Sg`, your header would look like this:

```
API-Key: oca_1jmGxFzT2RJBUY9wOOEC3Sg
```
## Response Codes
One Click Apply uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.
