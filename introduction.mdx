Applying to jobs today is time-consuming and repetitive. Most traditional methods involve tedious repetitive form filling.

Our One-Click Apply API is the first API for applying to jobs. You can apply for a job by sending an API request. It enables new ways to apply, like one click, swipe, or even a voice command. 

## How to Navigate through One-Click Apply Docs
- The documentation tab (where you are looking at now) will contain pricing and contact information.

- The [API Reference](https://docs.oneclickapply.co/api-reference/introduction) contains detailed spec and definitions of our API.
